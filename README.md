# Truck Jobs ðŸšš
Truck Jobs is a plugin that allows players to take on the open road via truck driving jobs where they can complete deliveries and earn payouts.

**Note:** Payouts are there for roleplay aspect. I may work on some sort of standalone banking framework if this gets enough traction and enable this to work with that.

## Features
- :eyes: **Job Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface to view and select available jobs.
- :construction_worker_man: **Dynamic Job Assignments:** Jobs are dynamically assigned based off the selected truck.
- :white_check_mark: **Completion Markers:** Ground markers at the drop-off locations to guide players.
- :money_mouth_face: **Payouts:** Earn (fake) money at the end of every job.
- :mechanical_arm: **Job State Management:** Robust job state management to prevent premature job endings.
- :white_circle: **Blip Integration:** Blips on the map for vehicles and delivery points.
- :gear: **Extremely Configurable:** Lots of configuration options to ensure this plugin is exactly how you want it!
- :oncoming_automobile: **Automatic Vehicle Cleanup:** Cleans up trucks when the job ending is triggered.
- :person_juggling: **Optimized for Multiple Players:** This plugin has been optimized for multiple players to use it at once.
